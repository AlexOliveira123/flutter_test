# Job Board

Make sure you have read the [README.md](https://github.com/Superformula/flutter_test/blob/master/README.md) first.

Be sure to read **all** of this document carefully, and follow the guidelines within.

## Context

A client needs to display a list of Jobs in their App and view details about them.

## Requirements

### Tasks

1. Build a simple app that fetches a list of jobs from GitHub Jobs that can be refreshed.
2. Be sure the app will have a navigation pattern present.
3. Write clear **documentation** on how it is designed and how to execute the code.
4. Write concise and clear commit messages.
5. Provide proper tests.

### UI

Attention to detail and your UI behavior will be noted, but here's a quick mock-up of how the app could look like:

### Real World Structure

Candidates should approach the project as if it were a real-world project, including whatever best practices they have discovered concerning architecture & structure.

### Test Coverage

Candidates should demonstrate the ability to test states **and** behaviors.

### API

Use [the GitHub Jobs API](https://jobs.github.com/api) that pulls a list of jobs.

### Bonus Requirements

These may be used for additional challenges. You can freely skip these if you are not asked to do them; feel free to try them out if you're up for it.

- Provide a method for a user where they could include a description in the query.
- Provide an offline api access strategy, for example with a cache.
- Provide test coverage.
- Works on some alternative environment (web preferably with an online demo).
- Demonstrates a basic CI/CD pipeline (installing deps and testing).
